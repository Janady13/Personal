  // a set forces uniqueness within its elements 


  new Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0]).size

  //the size element doesn't allow repenting elements 

  new Set2([1,1,2,3,4,5]).size

  // it would throw out the repeating number

  new Set3 ([[1],[2],[3],[3],[3]])

  // But it will not throw out seperate arrays to get the values of a set we have to iterate over it. You can use a foorloop

  for (const num of numbers) {
    console.log(num)
  }
  //This is one way to keep arrays from repeating themselves and keep things from repeating.
